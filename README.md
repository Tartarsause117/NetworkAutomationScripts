# Network Automation Scripts
A collection of python scripts written for my programming for network engineer class.

These scripts use netmiko to handle the connection to a cisco switch or router but can also be adjusted to work with other networking devices.
TTKBootstrap has also been used to handle the GUI elements to make it easy to use removing the need for someone to manually enter credentials or the file location of the credentials everytime.
